# Preview the website locally
quarto preview
```

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting a PR:

```bash
# Test Quarto rendering
quarto render

# Run validation scripts (if adding/modifying benchmarks)
python .github/scripts/validate_benchmark.py
python .github/scripts/validate_data.py
```

## Submission Guidelines

### Benchmark Submissions

- **One benchmark per PR**: Submit each benchmark separately
- **Complete documentation**: Include all required sections in `index.qmd`
- **Valid data**: Ensure CSV files load correctly
