title: "Pharmacometrics Benchmarks"
---

## Welcome

This repository is a place where researchers can upload benchmark datasets for pharmacometrics.

The datasets will mostly be synthetic with some strong demands on how realistic and well crafted they are. Each benchmark PR will essentially constitute a peer reviewed paper with a DOI and the review process will be rigorous.

## Core Purpose

A core purpose is to enable the quantification of performance of different modelling methodology in a way that makes it easier to compare different methodology papers with each other. We will also be able to host competitions.

## Why Benchmarks Matter

Standardized benchmarks enable:

- **Reproducible comparisons** between different methodological approaches
- **Transparent evaluation** of new methods against established baselines
- **Community-driven standards** for pharmacometric modeling
- **Competitive innovation** through organized challenges
